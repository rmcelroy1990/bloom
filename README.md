**<b><h2>About Bloom:</h2></b>** Bloom is a floral shop tracking app where users can keep track of floral shops throughout the United States. Whether users want weekly inspiration or an Instagram-worthy arrangement or need to add a home touch while on vacation, Bloom has users covered! Picture your floral wish, delivered. 

I created this app because I enjoy buying, gifting, and receiving flowers on a regular basis. Flowers always uplift my spirits and I enjoy watching Flowers Bloom! I love sitting in nature and appreciate all the natural beauty within the simplest things like flowers.
